/*****************************************************************************
Example sketch for driving Adafruit WS2801 pixels!


  Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit RGB Pixels!
  12mm Bullet shape ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/322
  12mm Flat shape   ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/738
  36mm Square shape ----> https://www.adafruit.com/products/683

  These pixels use SPI to transmit the color data, and have built in
  high speed PWM drivers for 24 bit color per pixel
  2 pins are required to interface

// Choose which 2 pins you will use for output.
// Can be any valid output pins.
// The colors of the wires may be totally different so
// BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR PIXELS TO SEE WHICH WIRES TO USE!
uint8_t dataPin  = 2;    // Yellow wire on Adafruit Pixels
uint8_t clockPin = 0;    // Green wire on Adafruit Pixels

// Don't forget to connect the ground wire to Arduino ground,
// and the +5V wire to a +5V supply

// Set the first variable to the NUMBER of pixels. 25 = 25 pixels in a row
Adafruit_WS2801 strip = Adafruit_WS2801(16, dataPin, clockPin);

// Optional: leave off pin numbers to use hardware SPI
// (pinout is then specific to each board and can't be changed)
//Adafruit_WS2801 strip = Adafruit_WS2801(25);

// For 36mm LED pixels: these pixels internally represent color in a
// different format.  Either of the above constructors can accept an
// optional extra parameter: WS2801_RGB is 'conventional' RGB order
// WS2801_GRB is the GRB order required by the 36mm pixels.  Other
// than this parameter, your code does not need to do anything different;
// the library will handle the format change.  Examples:
//Adafruit_WS2801 strip = Adafruit_WS2801(25, dataPin, clockPin, WS2801_GRB);
//Adafruit_WS2801 strip = Adafruit_WS2801(25, WS2801_GRB);

void setup() {
    
  strip.begin();

  // Update LED contents, to start they are all 'off'
  strip.show();
}


void loop() {
  // Some example procedures showing how to display to the pixels
  
  colorWipe(Color(255, 0, 0), 50);
  delay(1000);
  colorWipe(Color(0, 255, 0), 50);
  delay(1000);
  colorWipe(Color(0, 0, 255), 50);
  delay(1000);
}

// fill the dots one after the other with said color
// good for testing purposes
void colorWipe(uint32_t c, uint8_t wait) {
  int i;
  
  for (i=0; i < strip.numPixels(); i++) {
      strip.setPixelColor(i, c);
      strip.show();
      delay(wait);
  }
}

/* Helper functions */

// Create a 24 bit color value from R,G,B
